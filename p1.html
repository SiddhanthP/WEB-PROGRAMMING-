<h2> HTML DISPLAY</h2>
<P>
You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.<Br>
Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.
With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.

The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed:
<p> A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically <br>add some white space 
(a margin) before and after a paragraph.</p>
