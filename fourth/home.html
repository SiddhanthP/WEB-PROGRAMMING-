<P>An ebook (short for electronic book), also known as an e-book or eBook, is a book publication <BR>
made available in electronic form, consisting of text, images, or both readable on the flat-panel display of computers or other electronic devices.<BR>
Although sometimes defined as "an electronic version of a printed book",some e-books exist without a printed equivalent. 
<BR>E-books can be read on dedicated e-reader devices, but also on any computer device that features a controllable viewing screen, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets and smartphones.</P>
